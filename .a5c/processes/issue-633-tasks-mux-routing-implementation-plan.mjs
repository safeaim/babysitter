/**
 * @process issue-633-tasks-mux-routing-implementation-plan
 * @description Plan and execute issue #633 with an idempotent audit: SDK and agent-platform task effect resolution must route through tasks-mux.
 * @inputs {
 *   issueNumber: number,
 *   baseBranch: string,
 *   dependencyIssues: number[],
 *   designDocs: string[],
 *   maxImplementationIterations: number,
 *   verificationCommands: string[]
 * }
 * @outputs { success: boolean, reuseAudit: object, runtimeCallPaths: object, plan: object, verification: object, delivery: object }
 *
 * Process-library research:
 * - .a5c/process-library/ was not present in this checkout; use the repository's SDK-managed library/ tree per docs/user-guide/features/process-library.md.
 * - library/processes/shared/runtime-call-tracer.js
 * - library/processes/shared/tdd-triplet.js
 * - library/processes/shared/completeness-gate.js
 * - specializations/sdk-platform-development/sdk-testing-strategy
 * - specializations/sdk-platform-development/cli-tool-development
 * - specializations/qa-testing-automation/contract-testing
 * - babysitter/tdd-quality-convergence
 * - docs/agent-reference/process-authoring.md
 *
 * Reuse-audit findings (REVIEW BEFORE PROCEEDING):
 * - Design docs already exist under docs/agent-mux-babysitter-integrations/, including tasks-mux-routing.md, effect-resolution.md, and testing.md.
 * - tasks-mux already exposes ResponderType, routeTask, AgentMuxResponderBackend, ExternalTrackerBackend, and BreakpointBackend seams on the current checkout.
 * - Current staging has routeTask in packages/tasks-mux/src/router.ts, AgentMuxResponderBackend in packages/tasks-mux/src/backends/agent-mux.ts, and ExternalTrackerBackend in packages/tasks-mux/src/backends/external-tracker.ts.
 * - Current staging has agent-platform resolveEffect delegating routable agent effects through tasks-mux in packages/agent-platform/src/harness/internal/createRun/orchestration/effects.ts.
 * - agent-platform already imports/mocks routeTask and AgentMuxResponderBackend in createRun orchestration tests, so implementation must audit current behavior before adding duplicate routing layers.
 * - SDK stop-hook continuation already references routeTask/isHostDelegableRoute, so plugin-mode work should be verified against that live path rather than recreating a separate decision path.
 * - Current staging has SDK task responderType serialization/validation in packages/sdk/src/tasks/types.ts, packages/sdk/src/tasks/defineTask.ts, and packages/sdk/src/tasks/kinds/index.ts.
 * - Existing process .a5c/processes/issue-633-route-effect-resolution-through-tasks-mux.mjs covers a broad implementation flow. This process is a fresh, plan-scoped artifact for issue #633 with an explicit completed-work audit and current-staging gap analysis.
 *
 * Repo-specific authoring note:
 * - Per docs/agent-reference/process-authoring.md, this process uses agent tasks for implementation and verification phases and keeps breakpoints sparse.
