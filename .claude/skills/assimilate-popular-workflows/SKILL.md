# Assimilate Popular Workflows

Search public GitHub repositories for SKILL.md files, classify each repo by archetype, and maintain structured research documents under `docs/reference-repos/[org]/[repo-name]/`. The goal is not to copy skills verbatim but to extract transferable value: processes for the babysitter process library, babysitter marketplace plugin ideas, and implicit procedural knowledge that can be codified into babysitter JS processes.

### Process Library Placement Rules

Extracted processes go into the babysitter process library (`plugins/babysitter/skills/babysit/process/`). Placement depends on scope:

| What it is | Where it goes | Examples |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| Full generic dev methodology (entire workflow paradigm) | `methodologies/<name>/` | agile, gsd, tdd, scrum, kanban, waterfall |
| Common cross-domain pattern (reusable across many specializations) | `specializations/shared/` | audit-pipeline, expert-advisory, progressive-disclosure |
| Domain-specific process | `specializations/<domain>/` | security-compliance, devops-sre-platform, data-science-ml |

**Important**: Do NOT place domain-specific processes in `methodologies/`. Only full, generic development methodologies belong there. A "k8s security audit" is `specializations/security-compliance/`, not a methodology. A "deep research pipeline" is `specializations/shared/` (cross-domain). A "TDD agent workflow" is `methodologies/atdd-tdd/` (full dev methodology).

### Plugin Ideas = Babysitter Marketplace Plugins

A babysitter plugin is a set of natural language instructions (markdown) or deterministic coded processes (JS) that an AI agent reads and executes to install a modular set of capabilities. A plugin contains at minimum `install.md` with instructions the AI agent follows to modify the user's project. See `docs/plugins.md` for the full specification.

When identifying plugin ideas, think about what could be distributed as an installable package:
- An `install.md` that interviews the user about their project, detects their stack, and installs relevant processes/configs/hooks
- A `configure.md` for reconfiguration
- Processes copied from the library into `.a5c/processes/`
- ESLint rules, git hooks, CI/CD templates, tool configs
- Migration files for version upgrades

**Valid plugin use case categories** (derived from the existing marketplace):

| Category | What the plugin installs | Examples |
|----------|-------------------------|----------|
| Security & Sandboxing | Lint rules, git hooks, scanning processes, sandboxing policies | basic-security, agentsh |
| Context & Memory | MCP servers for memory, lifecycle hooks for auto-capture | claude-mem, mempalace |
| Knowledge Management | Wiki systems, knowledge graphs, semantic search engines | llm-wiki, graphify, qmd |
| Developer Experience & UX | Status indicators, session landing pages, skill recommenders | ctx, status-line, welcome |
| Tools Integration | Browser automation, external tool integration, MCP tools for new capabilities | dev-browser, prompt-master |
| CI/CD Integration | GitHub Actions workflows, harness-specific pipeline templates | github-actions-cicd-* |
| DevOps & Infrastructure | IaC templates, deployment configs, cloud provider setup | project-deployment |
| Quality Assurance & Testing | Test frameworks, coverage gates, linting configs, pre-commit hooks | testing-suite |
| Workflow Automation | Rate limit handling, auto-retry logic, lifecycle event hooks | rate-limit-handler |
| Theming & Environment | Sound hooks, design systems, conversational personality, themed assets | themes, sound-hooks |

## When to use

- User asks to discover what skills or workflows exist in popular repos.
- User asks to research a specific repo's skill ecosystem.
- User asks to extract processes or patterns from external skills.
- Periodic refresh to track the evolving skill landscape.

## Phase 1 -- Discovery

Search GitHub for repositories containing SKILL.md files. Use multiple search strategies to cast a wide net:

```bash
# Primary: find SKILL.md files in public repos
gh search code "filename:SKILL.md" --json repository,path,url --limit 100

# Supplementary: search for skill frontmatter patterns
gh search code "description:" "filename:SKILL.md" --json repository,path,url --limit 100

# Claude Code plugin skills specifically
gh search code "plugin.json" "skills" --json repository,path,url --limit 100
```

### Filtering rules

1. Drop any hit from `a5c-ai/babysitter` (this repo).
2. Drop archived repos.
3. Dedupe by `repository.nameWithOwner`.
4. Group hits by repo -- one repo may contain many SKILL.md files.

### Enrichment

For each surviving repo:

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<name> \
  --jq '{nameWithOwner, description, stargazerCount: .stargazers_count, pushedAt: .pushed_at, topics, license: .license.spdx_id}'
```

Record the list of SKILL.md paths found per repo.

## Phase 2 -- Classification

For each repo, shallow-clone into `.a5c/tmp/skill-discovery/` and investigate the structure. Classify into exactly one archetype:

| Archetype | Description | Action |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `mega-skill-pack` | Repo exists to distribute many skills across domains | Deep-dive: catalog all skills, extract patterns |
| `methodology-repo` | Repo represents a specific workflow or methodology | Extract the methodology as a potential babysitter process |
| `internal-maintenance` | Skills exist only for the repo's own CI/dev workflow | **Skip** -- not transferable |
| `other-harness` | Skill is specific to a non-Claude harness (Codex, Cursor, etc.) or focused on harness invocation/CLI orchestration | **Skip** -- not transferable to babysitter processes |
| `claude-plugin` | A Claude Code plugin with skills as part of its offering | Investigate plugin structure, extractable integrations |
| `domain-skill-pack` | Skills focused on a specific domain (e.g., data science, DevOps) | Extract domain processes and patterns |
| `utility-with-skill` | A tool/library that ships a SKILL.md for usage guidance | Extract the usage pattern as a potential shared process |
| `not-a-skill` | Repo uses SKILL.md as generic docs, no Claude Code connection | **Skip** -- no frontmatter, no agent context |

### Classification signals

Read the repo's top-level README, plugin.json (if present), directory structure, and a sample of SKILL.md files. Look for:

- **mega-skill-pack**: `skills/` directory with 5+ subdirectories, no primary application code
- **methodology-repo**: Process/workflow documentation dominates, SKILL.md describes a methodology
- **internal-maintenance**: SKILL.md references only internal paths, CI pipelines, repo-specific tooling
- **other-harness**: Skill is for Codex, Cursor, or another non-Claude harness; or focuses on CLI orchestration / harness invocation patterns
- **claude-plugin**: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` or `plugin.json` with skill registrations
- **domain-skill-pack**: Skills all relate to one domain; directory structure groups by topic
- **utility-with-skill**: Repo is primarily a library/tool; SKILL.md is usage documentation

## Phase 3 -- Deep Research

For each non-skipped repo, produce research under `docs/reference-repos/[org]/[repo-name]/`. Create these files:

### `index.md` -- Overview and assessment

```markdown
# [org]/[repo-name]

- **Archetype**: mega-skill-pack | methodology-repo | claude-plugin | domain-skill-pack | utility-with-skill
- **Stars**: N
- **Last pushed**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **License**: MIT / Apache-2.0 / ...
- **Discovered**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Skills found**: N

## Summary
<2-3 sentences on what the repo provides and why it's interesting>

## Assessment
<What is transferable? What is repo-specific? Quality of skill design?>

## Extraction Priority
- High / Medium / Low
- Rationale: <why>
```

### `skills-inventory.md` -- Catalog of all skills found

```markdown
# Skills Inventory: [org]/[repo-name]

| Skill | Path | Domain | Transferable? | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|---------------|-------|
| skill-name | skills/foo/SKILL.md | DevOps | Yes - pattern | Describes a CI/CD workflow |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

### `extractable-value.md` -- The core deliverable

Organized into sections:

```markdown
# Extractable Value: [org]/[repo-name]

## Processes
<Workflows that can be codified as babysitter JS processes>
- **Process name**: Description of what it does
  - Source: path/to/SKILL.md (lines N-M)
  - Placement: methodologies/<name> | specializations/shared | specializations/<domain>
  - Inputs/Outputs: ...
  - Complexity: simple | moderate | complex
  - Notes: ...

## Plugin Ideas
<Ideas for babysitter marketplace plugins -- installable packages with install.md
that an AI agent executes to set up capabilities in a user's project>
- **Plugin name**: What it installs and configures
  - What install.md would do: <what the AI agent does during install -- detect stack, interview user, copy processes, set up hooks/configs>
  - Processes it would copy: <which process library entries>
  - Configs/hooks it would create: <ESLint rules, git hooks, CI/CD templates, etc.>
  - Source evidence: <what in the repo inspires this plugin idea>

## Implicit Procedural Knowledge
<Procedures that are described narratively in SKILL.md files but should be
codified as deterministic JS processes for the babysitter process library>
- **Procedure name**: What it accomplishes
  - Source: SKILL.md section or description text
  - Placement: methodologies/<name> | specializations/shared | specializations/<domain>
  - Why codify: <what makes this better as a process than a skill>
  - Sketch: <brief outline of phases/tasks>
```

## Phase 4 -- Process Codification

For entries in the "Implicit Procedural Knowledge" section that are high-priority, scaffold a babysitter process file. Use the `process-builder` skill patterns from `.claude/skills/process-builder/SKILL.md`.

Process files go in `.a5c/processes/assimilated/` as staging candidates. After review, they are promoted into the process library at their designated placement path.

```
.a5c/processes/assimilated/
├── [org]-[repo]-[process-name].cjs          # Staged candidate
└── ...

# After review, promoted to process library:
# methodologies/<name>/                       # Full generic dev methodologies only
# specializations/shared/                     # Cross-domain reusable patterns
# specializations/<domain>/                   # Domain-specific processes
```

Use `.cjs` extension because `.a5c/package.json` sets `"type": "module"`.

Each process must:
- Import `defineTask` from `@a5c-ai/babysitter-sdk`
- Export `async function process(inputs, ctx)`
- Include `@references` pointing back to the source SKILL.md
- Include `@process assimilated/[name]` tag
- Include `@placement` tag indicating the target library path (e.g. `@placement specializations/security-compliance/k8s-audit`)
- Honour the source repo's license in the JSDoc header

## Phase 5 -- Maintain the master index

Keep `docs/reference-repos/README.md` as a top-level index:

```markdown
# Reference Repos

<!-- Generated by .claude/skills/assimilate-popular-workflows. Re-run to refresh. -->

Last refreshed: YYYY-MM-DD
Total repos tracked: N
Skipped (internal-maintenance): K

## Notes

- Never copy SKILL.md content wholesale. Extract the *procedural insight*, not the prose.
- Respect source licenses. Include attribution in every extracted process file.
- Skills that are purely prompt-engineering (just a system prompt with no procedure) have no extractable process value -- note them as `not-transferable` in the inventory.
- **Skip skill-management processes** (skill-routing, skill-discovery pipelines, skill-validation, skill-metadata checks). These are babysitter-internal concerns, not transferable domain processes. Their associated *plugin ideas* (e.g., a skill-registry-browser plugin) may still be valid.
- **Skip multi-model coordination processes** (multi-model review, heterogeneous AI team orchestration). Babysitter's harness adapter system already handles multi-model dispatch natively. These don't add value as library processes.
- **Skip patterns already covered by the SDK**: human-in-the-loop review cycles (covered by breakpoints), harness CLI invocation/degradation (covered by harness adapters), effect dispatch coordination (covered by the runtime). Only extract processes that add *domain-specific* or *workflow-specific* value beyond what the SDK primitives provide.
- **Memory systems are always plugins, never processes.** Memory management (tiered storage, decay, reflection, promotion) belongs in the Context & Memory plugin category. Do not place memory-related workflows in the process library -- they are plugin-internal logic installed via `install.md`.
- The `internal-maintenance` archetype is the most common. Expect 60-70% of hits to be skipped.
- Rate-limit awareness: `gh search code` is throttled at 30 req/min. Split searches by language qualifier if hitting caps.
- When a repo has already been researched (directory exists under `docs/reference-repos/`), update in-place rather than recreating. Compare `pushedAt` dates to decide if re-investigation is needed.
- For very large skill packs (20+ skills), sample the most-starred or most-recently-updated skills rather than researching all of them in a single pass.
- After completing research, suggest the user run `/babysitter:contrib` for any upstream-worthy process candidates.
- See `references/classification-heuristics.md` for detailed archetype classification examples and edge cases.
