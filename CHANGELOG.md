### Fixed
- Restored the automatic stop-hook drive of `babysitter run:iterate` inside Claude Code and GitHub Copilot sessions. Two regressions had broken the chain: (a) `setBabysitterSessionIdInEnvFile` (and its Copilot twin) rewrote `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE`/`COPILOT_ENV_FILE` via `writeFileSync(tmp)+renameSync`, breaking the harness env-sourcing contract that relies on append-only writes to a stable inode; (b) the session-start PID-marker writer emitted `current-session-pid-<pid>` while the reader expected the slugged `current-session-claude-code-pid-<pid>`, causing the marker rail to always miss. The writer now goes through `getSessionMarkerPath()` so writer and reader agree, and the env-file helpers are append-only. The resolver's last-match regex already tolerates accumulated exports from repeated session rotation, so append-only is safe.
- Inverted session-ID resolution precedence across all harness adapters to prefer the PID-scoped session marker (authoritative, tied to live ancestor Claude Code PID) over the inheritable `BABYSITTER_SESSION_ID` env var, which previously caused cross-session bleed when a parent shell had a stale export.
- Env-file stale-line hazard: resolver uses last-match regex, tolerating the multiple `export BABYSITTER_SESSION_ID=...` lines that accumulate as `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` is appended to across session rotation (/clear, re-init).
- Replaced legacy `wmic` with a PowerShell `Get-CimInstance` fallback cascade for Windows 11 24H2+, where `wmic` has been removed from the base image.
- Added `session:whoami` and `session:cleanup` commands, plus four new `/babysitter:doctor` checks covering session-binding provenance and liveness.
- Added `BABYSITTER_TRUST_ENV_SESSION=1` escape hatch to retain legacy env-first precedence for CI workflows that deliberately export `BABYSITTER_SESSION_ID`.
- Closes #130; related to previously-fixed #100, #107, #75.

Major release featuring a complete hook system overhaul, Docker-based deployment, harness adapter architecture for agent-agnostic compatibility, a growing process library with methodology assimilation, and many new slash commands.

Thank you for the active contributions and support: @YoavMayer , @MaTriXy , @guyelia , @Eyaldavid7 , @giladw , @yosit , @lorg , @davidt99 , @OriAshkenazi , @hexelon and others!

### Added

#### Slash Commands
- `/babysitter:doctor` — Run diagnostics
- `/babysitter:observe` — Observer dashboard for real-time process monitoring and management
- `/babysitter:yolo` — No breakpoint, fully autonomous execution mode
- `/babysitter:resume` — Resume interrupted or paused runs
- `/babysitter:help` — Usage guides for all babysitter commands and workflows, processes, skills, agents, and methodologies
- `/babysitter:plan` — Structured planning workflows
- `/babysitter:forever` — Long-running orchestration sessions
- `/babysitter:assimilate` — Convert external AI coding methodologies into babysitter process definitions, or integrate specific AI harness with the babysitter SDK (e.g. codex, opencode, antigravity)
- `/babysitter:call` — Invoke babysitter orchestration directly
- `/babysitter:project-install` and `/babysitter:user-install` — Setup and customize babysitter at project or user level

#### Core Features
- **Profiles SDK module** with CLI commands for managing user and project profiles
- **Process-driven skill and agent discovery** using JSDoc markers for better extensibility
- **Harness adapter architecture** for agent-agnostic session binding (fixes #7)
  - Claude-specific code centralized into harness adapter module
  - Auto-detection of harness environment when binding sessions
  - `--harness` flag on `run:create` for adapter selection
  - Foundation for supporting non-Claude hosts (Codex, OpenCode, etc.)
- **Session transcript capture and verification** for full orchestration lifecycle tracking
  - Structural transcript parsing for reliable stop hook verification
- **Initial prompt now persisted** in `run.json` and `RUN_CREATED` events (fixes #8)

#### Process Library
- **Methodology assimilation workflow** for converting external AI coding processes into babysitter process definitions
- **Harness integration process** — process definition for adapting the SDK to non-Claude environments
- **Codebase security audit process** for systematic security compliance scanning
- **GSD (Get Stuff Done) processes** properly converted to babysitter process definitions
- **Assimilated external methodologies**:
  - BMAD Method (bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD)
  - Superpowers Extended (pcvelz/superpowers)
  - Gas Town (steveyegge/gastown)
  - RPIKit (bostonaholic/rpikit)
  - CC10X (romiluz13/cc10x)
  - Metaswarm (dsifry/metaswarm)
  - and many more

#### Infrastructure
- **Docker support** as primary deployment method with comprehensive E2E testing
- **Staging publish workflow** for better release management
- **Breakpoints service and legacy editor extension surfaces completely removed** from the system
- **Completion secret renamed to completion proof** throughout the API for clearer semantics

### Fixed

#### Hook System
- **Hook invocation mechanism changed** from shell scripts to SDK CLI `hook:run` command for better reliability and maintainability
- **Stop hook** no longer bails on empty prompts when run is bound to a session
- **Stop hook** now uses `last_assistant_message` fallback for better reliability
- **Stop hook skill context** improved by excluding babysit, capping at 10, showing full paths
- **Stop hook** preserves session file when run state is unknown instead of deleting it, allowing recovery
- **Stop hook** fallback run directory search for nested `.a5c/.a5c/runs/` paths created by babysit skill
- **Session-start hook** creates baseline state file proactively
- **Session-start hook** prevents hanging by ensuring clean stdin EOF handling
- **Session-start hook** installs babysitter CLI from correct SDK version

#### Breakpoints
- **Breakpoint response validation for interactive mode** — `AskUserQuestion` responses are now validated; empty or dismissed responses are no longer silently treated as approval (fixes #19)

#### State Management
- **State cache** rebuilt after terminal events ensuring data consistency

#### CLI & Build
- **CLI exit codes** properly propagated via `process.exitCode`
- **Plugin version** derived dynamically instead of being hardcoded
- **Build system fixes** including rollup workarounds and npm optional dependencies
- **Deprecated transitive dependencies** updated — resolved npm audit warnings for glob, tar, rimraf, inflight, npmlog, etc. (fixes #10)

#### Discovery & Execution
- **Discovery bloat** removed from `run:iterate` with compacted `run:create` output
- **Irrelevant specialization skills** excluded from discovery with capped summary length
- **Harness CLI flag** respected for adapter selection in `run:create`
- **Run directory resolution** improved with doubled `.a5c` path collapsing
- **Shared `resolveInputPath` utility** prevents double-nested `.a5c/runs` paths
- **Runaway loop detection threshold** increased from 3 to 10 consecutive fast iterations to reduce false positives

#### E2E & Testing
- **Session transcript format handling** fixed for real Claude Code output
- **Stop hook verification tests** made resilient to non-interactive (`-p`) mode
- **E2E orchestration tests** handle nested run directory paths with recursive search and post-run consolidation
- **E2E journal verification** allows `STOP_HOOK_INVOKED` events after `RUN_COMPLETED`
- **E2E credential handling** fixed for Azure Foundry and multiple API key formats

### Improved

#### Architecture
- **Hook system refactored** from shell scripts to SDK CLI `hook:run` command
- **Session binding** auto-configures when harness and session-id are provided
- **Discovery expanded** to agents and processes for broader capability coverage

#### Observability
- **Comprehensive diagnostic logging** throughout stop hook execution paths
- **Doctor command enhanced** with hook execution health diagnostics
- **Run verification** more resilient with better error handling and diagnostics

#### Documentation
- **Command files rewritten** with improved structure and closed process gaps
- **Assimilation documentation** for converting external methodologies and harnesses
- **Orchestration loop rules** and common mistakes clarified in SKILL.md
- **Research and plan output** improved readability (fixes #9)
- **E2E test coverage** significantly expanded for hooks, profiles, and orchestration

### Added
- Explorer context command `Babysitter: Dispatch Run from Task File` that trims `.task.md` content and invokes the standard dispatch flow.
- Continuous release pipeline (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) with pinned actions, checksum-protected VSIX artifacts, helper scripts for semantic versioning/release notes, and a documented rollback script (`scripts/rollback-release.sh` + `docs/release-pipeline.md`).

## [0.0.3] - 2026-01-05

### Added

- Initial packaged editor observer surface with run discovery, monitoring, UI views, and `o` integration scaffolding.
