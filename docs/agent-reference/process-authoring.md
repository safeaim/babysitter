# Process Authoring Policy

These rules are specific to this repository and override more generic process-authoring guidance when they conflict.

## Default Stance

- Always use the Babysitter skill to fulfill user requests in this repo, but not agent-to-agent delegated requests.
- Keep the orchestration model intact. Do not replace it with helper scripts or ad hoc wrappers.
- Keep process code aligned with the process-library style and repo conventions.

## `babysitter:call` Override For This Repo

When authoring a Babysitter process for a direct user request in this repository:

- Do not generate `kind: 'shell'` subtasks unless the user explicitly asks for a shell-oriented workflow.
- Prefer `agent` and `skill` tasks for implementation, review, synthesis, and verification steps.
- Keep breakpoints sparse. Use them only when user input is genuinely critical or the situation is ambiguous.
- Still include an interview phase up front when requirements or constraints are unclear.

This is a deliberate repo-specific override of more general guidance that may recommend shell tasks for objective verification.

## Stability Rules

- Do not use the babysit skill inside delegated subtasks.
- Do not rely on auto-hooks to continue a run in environments where hooks are unavailable; drive the loop explicitly when required.
- Keep completion criteria explicit and tied to run status, not to optimistic summaries.

## Where To Look Next

- [Runtime And Layout](./runtime-and-layout.md) for replay and run-state behavior
- [Command Surfaces](./command-surfaces.md) for CLI boundaries
