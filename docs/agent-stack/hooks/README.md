# Agent Stack Hooks — Gap Analysis & Specs

Claude Code defines 30 hook events. The atlas graph and hooks-mux canonical contract cover all 30, and agent-mux now registers native Claude runtime hooks for the concrete events that have a runtime source. This directory documents remaining SDK/platform emission gaps and specs for full parity.
