## Priority 1: Master Target Registries — ✅ Complete

| Item | Status | Commit |
|------|--------|--------|
| P1.1 — `buildPluginTargetDescriptors()` | ✅ Reads from Atlas | d30b5d08 |
| P1.2 — SDK discovery specs | ✅ `buildDiscoverySpecs()` from catalog | abb240e9 |
| P1.3 — `deriveProcessNames()` | ✅ Queries catalog `processNames` | abb240e9 |
| P1.4 — adapter registry | ✅ Built from `listPluginTargetDescriptors()` | 0d56cc84 (earlier) |

**Residual:** P1.3 has 3 hardcoded alias fallbacks (`claude`→`claude-code`, `gemini`→`gemini-cli`, `copilot`→`github-copilot`) for when exact match fails. Low priority.

## Priority 2: Per-Target Type Definitions — ✅ Complete

| Item | Status | Commit |
|------|--------|--------|
| P2.1 — `HookRegistrationFormat` | ✅ Changed to `string` | 12b07f8e |
| P2.2 — `HARNESS_ALIASES` | ✅ Dynamic from catalog | 12b07f8e |

## Priority 3: Per-Target Special Cases — ✅ Complete

| Item | Status | Commit |
|------|--------|--------|
| P3.1 — openclaw Stop hook | ✅ Checks `adapterFamily === 'programmatic'` | c0d76911 |
| P3.2 — codex marketplace | ✅ Checks `activationMessage` | c0d76911 |
| P3.3 — copilot bin scripts | ✅ Checks `componentSupport + lifecycle` | c0d76911 |
| P3.4 — oh-my-pi adapter name | ✅ Uses `targetProfile.adapterName` | c0d76911 |

**Zero `targetProfile.name ===` checks remain in agent-plugins-mux production code.**

## Priority 4: Env Vars and Install Paths — ✅ Complete (via P1.2)

Discovery specs now read `callerEnvVars` and `configPaths` from Atlas PluginTarget records. Hardcoded values remain only as fallback defaults in lazy getters.

## Priority 5: agent-mux Dispatch — ⬜ By Design

| Item | Status | Note |
|------|--------|------|
| P5.1 — translate-for-harness | ⬜ Code | Adapter self-identification — each adapter knows what it is |
| P5.2 — CLI launch routing | ⬜ Code | Launch commands are inherently per-adapter code |
| P5.3 — interactive-mode targets | ⬜ Code | Process definition, not data lookup |

These are **code dispatches**, not data lookups. Each adapter file (`claude-adapter.ts`, `codex-adapter.ts`) must identify itself. A registry pattern could replace the switch statements but the individual adapter imports would still be hardcoded.

### P5.4 — `BuiltInAgentName` type (packages/agent-mux/core/src/types.ts)
- **What:** `type BuiltInAgentName = 'claude' | 'codex' | 'droid' | 'amp' | 'gemini' | 'copilot' | 'cursor' | 'opencode' | 'pi' | 'omp' | ...`
- **Note:** `AgentName = BuiltInAgentName | (string & {})` already accepts any string. The union is for IDE autocomplete only.
- **Fix:** Could be generated at build time from Atlas. Low priority since the `(string & {})` fallback makes it non-breaking.
- **Status:** 🟡 Low priority — autocomplete convenience only

### P5.5 — `translateForHarness` switch (packages/agent-mux/adapters/src/translate-for-harness.ts)
- **What:** Switch on agent name dispatching to per-harness translation functions
- **Note:** Each translation is different code logic (claude, codex, gemini, opencode each have unique provider translation). Cannot be data-driven.
- **Status:** ⬜ By design — code dispatch

### P5.6 — Adapter self-identification (packages/agent-mux/adapters/src/*-adapter.ts)
- **What:** Each adapter class has `readonly agent = 'claude'`, `readonly cliCommand = 'claude'`, etc.
- **Note:** 26 adapter files with hardcoded identity. Could read from catalog at construction but adds complexity for no functional benefit.
- **Fix:** Could accept `agent` and `cliCommand` as constructor params sourced from catalog. Marginal value.
- **Status:** ⬜ By design — adapter self-identity

## Priority 6: Scripts and CI — 🟡 Mostly Complete

| Item | Status | Note |
|------|--------|------|
| P6.1 — Architecture boundaries | ✅ | Removed plugin bundle entries (938924c3) |
| P6.2 — Bump version targets | ✅ | Plugin bundles removed — no paths to maintain |
| P6.3 — Sync external repos | 🔴 | `targets` array with repo URLs still hardcoded |
| P6.4 — Docs freshness | ✅ | Queries catalog with fallback (ecbc2c59) |

**P6.3 remaining:** `scripts/sync-external-plugin-repos.mjs` has a hardcoded array mapping target IDs to external repo URLs (`a5c-ai/babysitter-codex`, etc.). Fix: add `externalRepo` field to Atlas PluginTarget records.

## Priority 7: Tests — ✅ Acceptable

| Item | Status | Note |
|------|--------|------|
| P7.1 — Transform tests | ✅ | Tests validate specific behavior — hardcoded assertions are correct |
| P7.2 — Contract tests | ✅ | Already catalog-driven |
