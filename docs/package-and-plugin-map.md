# Package and Plugin Docs Map

This page is the canonical discovery index for package and plugin documentation in the Babysitter monorepo.

Use it to answer three questions quickly:

1. Is this surface public, public-but-advanced, or internal-only?
2. Where is the canonical documentation home for that surface right now?
3. Which surfaces still rely on a package README or this map instead of a dedicated docs-site page?

`docs/workspace-validation.md` remains the validation-contract ledger. It is **not** the primary docs discovery entrypoint anymore.

## Status labels

- **Public package**: supported public npm or app surface.
- **Public advanced/runtime package**: public and supported, but primarily for operator/runtime workflows rather than first-time users.
- **Public family package**: a published package that belongs to a larger package family whose overview docs also matter.
- **Public harness plugin**: a supported harness/plugin surface for a specific host.
- **Internal-only workspace**: active inside this monorepo, but not documented as a productized public offering.
- **Internal-only companion app**: repo-active support app surface with no separate public docs contract.

## Family entrypoints

| Surface | Status | Canonical docs home | Supporting entrypoints | Coverage note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `packages/agent-mux` | Public family overview | [packages/agent-mux/README.md](../packages/agent-mux/README.md) | [docs/agent-mux/README.md](./agent-mux/README.md) | Use this family README to enter the agent-mux workspace tree before dropping into package-specific READMEs. |
| `packages/hooks-mux` | Public family overview | [packages/hooks-mux/README.md](../packages/hooks-mux/README.md) | [packages/hooks-mux/core/README.md](../packages/hooks-mux/core/README.md)<br />[packages/hooks-mux/cli/README.md](../packages/hooks-mux/cli/README.md) | Use this family README for the hooks-mux package set and adapter lineup. |
| `plugins` | Public plugin overview | [docs/plugins.md](./plugins.md) | [plugins/babysitter-unified/per-harness/claude-code/README.md](../plugins/babysitter-unified/per-harness/claude-code/README.md)<br />[plugins/babysitter-unified/per-harness/codex/README.md](../plugins/babysitter-unified/per-harness/codex/README.md) | `plugins/babysitter-unified/` is the canonical source. Generated harness bundles are published from that source and are not maintained as checked-in directories here. |

## Public core and runtime packages

| Surface | Status | Canonical docs home | Supporting entrypoints | Coverage note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `packages/agent-plugins-mux` | Public package | [packages/agent-plugins-mux/README.md](../packages/agent-plugins-mux/README.md) | — | README is the canonical package-level contract. |
| `packages/agent-core` | Public advanced/runtime package | [packages/agent-core/README.md](../packages/agent-core/README.md) | [docs/release-pipeline.md](./release-pipeline.md) | Public runtime dependency package for advanced orchestration surfaces; README is the canonical package contract. |
| `packages/babysitter` | Public package | [packages/babysitter/README.md](../packages/babysitter/README.md) | — | README is the canonical package-level contract. |
| `packages/babysitter-agent` | Public advanced/runtime package | [packages/babysitter-agent/README.md](../packages/babysitter-agent/README.md) | [README.md](../README.md) | Public npm package, but it is an advanced/operator-facing runtime CLI rather than the default entrypoint for new users. |
| `packages/agent-catalog` | Public advanced/runtime package | [packages/agent-catalog/README.md](../packages/agent-catalog/README.md) | [docs/release-pipeline.md](./release-pipeline.md) | Public npm package for shared ontology/discovery/evidence assets used by other published runtimes; README is the canonical package contract. |
| `packages/breakpoints-mux` | Public package | [packages/breakpoints-mux/README.md](../packages/breakpoints-mux/README.md) | — | README is the canonical package-level contract. |
| `packages/cloud` | Public package | [packages/cloud/README.md](../packages/cloud/README.md) | — | README is the canonical public docs home today; the validation matrix does not currently expose a separate central docs entrypoint for this package. |
| `packages/krate/core` | Public package | [docs/package-and-plugin-map.md](./package-and-plugin-map.md) | — | Kubernetes-native Git forge runtime. No package README today; this map is the documentation home until a README is added. |
| `packages/sdk` | Public package | [packages/sdk/README.md](../packages/sdk/README.md) | — | README is the canonical package-level contract. |

## Coverage rules for future changes

- If a new active workspace or plugin is added, update this map in the same change.
- If a public surface still relies only on a package README, note that explicitly here until a docs-site page exists.
- If a surface is internal-only, say so plainly here or in the package README instead of implying external product support.
- If a package or plugin is promoted from internal-only to public, update the package metadata, README status block, and this map together.
