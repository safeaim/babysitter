# Package and Plugin Docs Map

This page is the canonical discovery index for package and plugin documentation in the Babysitter monorepo.

Use it to answer three questions quickly:

1. Is this surface public, public-but-advanced, or internal-only?
2. Where is the canonical documentation home for that surface right now?
3. Which surfaces still rely on a package README or this map instead of a dedicated docs-site page?

`docs/workspace-validation.md` remains the validation-contract ledger. It is **not** the primary docs discovery entrypoint anymore.

## Status labels

- **Public package**: supported public npm or app surface.
- **Public advanced/runtime package**: public and supported, but primarily for operator/runtime workflows rather than first-time users.
- **Public family package**: a published package that belongs to a larger package family whose overview docs also matter.
- **Public harness plugin**: a supported harness/plugin surface for a specific host.
- **Internal-only workspace**: active inside this monorepo, but not documented as a productized public offering.
- **Internal-only companion app**: repo-active support app surface with no separate public docs contract.

## Family entrypoints

## Internal-only workspaces and companion apps

| Surface | Status | Canonical docs home | Supporting entrypoints | Coverage note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `packages/agent-core` | Internal-only workspace | [packages/agent-core/README.md](../packages/agent-core/README.md) | — | Repo-internal runtime/tool surface consumed by advanced runtime flows; do not present it as a standalone public product offering. |
| `packages/agent-mux/mobile-android-app` | Internal-only companion app | [docs/package-and-plugin-map.md](./package-and-plugin-map.md) | [docs/agent-mux/README.md](./agent-mux/README.md) | No package README today. This map is the explicit internal-only note until the surface is promoted. |
| `packages/agent-mux/mobile-ios-app` | Internal-only companion app | [docs/package-and-plugin-map.md](./package-and-plugin-map.md) | [docs/agent-mux/README.md](./agent-mux/README.md) | No package README today. This map is the explicit internal-only note until the surface is promoted. |
| `packages/agent-mux/tv-androidtv-app` | Internal-only companion app | [docs/package-and-plugin-map.md](./package-and-plugin-map.md) | [docs/agent-mux/README.md](./agent-mux/README.md) | No package README today. This map is the explicit internal-only note until the surface is promoted. |
| `packages/agent-mux/tv-appletv-app` | Internal-only companion app | [docs/package-and-plugin-map.md](./package-and-plugin-map.md) | [docs/agent-mux/README.md](./agent-mux/README.md) | No package README today. This map is the explicit internal-only note until the surface is promoted. |
| `packages/agent-mux/watch-watchos-app` | Internal-only companion app | [docs/package-and-plugin-map.md](./package-and-plugin-map.md) | [docs/agent-mux/README.md](./agent-mux/README.md) | No package README today. This map is the explicit internal-only note until the surface is promoted. |
| `packages/agent-mux/watch-wearos-app` | Internal-only companion app | [docs/package-and-plugin-map.md](./package-and-plugin-map.md) | [docs/agent-mux/README.md](./agent-mux/README.md) | No package README today. This map is the explicit internal-only note until the surface is promoted. |
| `packages/babysitter-tui-plugins` | Internal-only workspace | [docs/package-and-plugin-map.md](./package-and-plugin-map.md) | — | Internal-only support package for the TUI surface. This map is the explicit documentation home until the workspace gets a README. |
| `packages/catalog` | Internal-only workspace | [packages/catalog/README.md](../packages/catalog/README.md) | — | Internal-only metadata/catalog surface. Keep discovery honest and routed through internal notes rather than productized public docs. |
| `packages/transport-mux` | Internal-only workspace | [packages/transport-mux/README.md](../packages/transport-mux/README.md) | [docs/workspace-validation.md](./workspace-validation.md) | Treat as an internal placeholder seam even though release/staging automation still validates its migration and packaging edges. |

## Coverage rules for future changes

- If a new active workspace or plugin is added, update this map in the same change.
- If a public surface still relies only on a package README, note that explicitly here until a docs-site page exists.
- If a surface is internal-only, say so plainly here or in the package README instead of implying external product support.
- If a package or plugin is promoted from internal-only to public, update the package metadata, README status block, and this map together.
