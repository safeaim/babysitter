## Summary
Comprehensive .NET developer skills from Aaron Stannard (Akka.NET creator/maintainer). 34 skills covering Akka.NET patterns (best practices, hosting, management, testing, Aspire integration), C# design (API design, coding standards, concurrency, type design/performance), ASP.NET/Aspire ecosystem (configuration, integration testing, service defaults, Mailpit, DevCert trust), Entity Framework Core, testing patterns (snapshot testing, Testcontainers, Playwright+Blazor, Verify email snapshots), tooling (ILSpy decompile, package management, serialization), and meta-skills (marketplace-publishing, project-structure, skills-index-snippets, slopwatch, CRAP analysis). The akka-best-practices skill is notably deep with patterns for EventStream vs DistributedPubSub, supervision strategies, work distribution, and cluster/local abstractions.

## Assessment
HIGH VALUE for domain specialization. This is the most authoritative .NET skills collection in the reference set -- authored by the creator of Akka.NET with deep expertise in distributed systems, actor patterns, and .NET ecosystem. The Akka.NET skills encode expert knowledge that is genuinely difficult to find elsewhere: cluster vs local abstractions for testability, actor-scoped CancellationToken patterns, and the critical distinction between EventStream (local-only) and DistributedPubSub (multi-node). The C# skills cover modern patterns (concurrency, type design for performance) that are applicable across all .NET projects. The testing skills (Testcontainers, Playwright+Blazor, snapshot testing) represent well-defined procedural workflows. Transferable to specializations/engineering/dotnet.

## Extraction Priority
- High
- Rationale: Authoritative source (Akka.NET creator), 34 deeply procedural skills, covers a major technology ecosystem (.NET) not yet represented in babysitter's process library. The distributed systems patterns (actor model, cluster abstractions) are genuinely expert-level knowledge. The breadth (Akka, Aspire, EF Core, testing, tooling) provides comprehensive .NET coverage.

## Processes
- **Akka.NET Actor Design Process**: Analyze communication needs -> choose EventStream (local) vs DistributedPubSub (multi-node) -> implement supervision strategy -> design work distribution -> abstract cluster/local for testability. A multi-decision architecture process.
- **.NET Testing Pipeline**: Choose testing strategy (snapshot/integration/E2E) -> configure Testcontainers for infrastructure -> implement Playwright for Blazor UI tests -> set up Verify for email snapshot testing. A comprehensive test infrastructure setup process.
- **Aspire Service Configuration**: Configure service defaults -> set up integration testing -> integrate external services (Mailpit, etc.) -> trust DevCert for local HTTPS. An infrastructure setup workflow.
- **C# Code Quality Process**: Apply coding standards -> analyze type design for performance -> implement concurrency patterns -> run CRAP analysis (Change Risk Anti-Pattern). A code quality methodology with quantitative metrics.
- **CRAP Analysis**: Cyclomatic complexity + code coverage metric for identifying risky code. A quantitative quality assessment extractable as a shared methodology.

## Plugin Ideas
- **.NET Expert plugin**: Install.md-driven plugin with 34 .NET skills covering Akka.NET, Aspire, C# patterns, EF Core, and testing. Configurable for which sub-domains to activate based on project dependencies.
- **Actor Model Patterns plugin**: Framework-agnostic actor model patterns plugin (applicable to Akka.NET, Akka/JVM, Orleans, Proto.Actor) with distribution/supervision/testing abstractions.
- **CRAP Analysis plugin**: A code quality assessment plugin implementing the Change Risk Anti-Pattern metric. Install.md sets up coverage tooling and complexity analysis.

## Patterns
- **Local vs distributed abstraction**: GenericChildPerEntityParent and IPubSubMediator abstractions that work identically in single-node and cluster modes. Enables testability without cluster infrastructure.
- **Invocable: false metadata**: Skills marked `invocable: false` serve as reference documentation rather than interactive skills. A useful distinction for knowledge bases vs. workflows.
- **Reference file architecture**: Per-skill reference files (work-distribution-patterns.md, cluster-local-abstractions.md, async-cancellation-patterns.md) linked from main SKILL.md. Modular knowledge organization.
- **Critical mistake highlighting**: "BAD" code examples with explicit explanation of why they fail (e.g., EventStream is local-only, subscribers on server 2 won't receive events). Negative examples with distributed-systems failure modes.
- **Framework creator authority**: Skills authored by the framework creator carry implicit authority. The Akka.NET skills can make definitive statements about intended usage patterns.
