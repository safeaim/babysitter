- **Skills found**: 20+ domain skills

## Summary
Comprehensive collection of LLM applications and agent skills with educational content. Contains 20+ high-quality domain skills (debugger, deep-research, academic-researcher, fullstack-developer, etc.) plus a sophisticated self-improving agent framework that automatically optimizes skills using multi-agent collaboration. Includes MCP agents, RAG tutorials, voice AI agents, and advanced AI agent frameworks.

## Assessment
Very high transferable value. Individual skills contain detailed procedural knowledge with systematic workflows (debugging process, research methodologies, development patterns). The self-improving agent system implements an automated skill optimization methodology using ADK agents (Executor, Analyst, Mutator) that could be adapted for babysitter's process library. Skills follow proper frontmatter format with clear usage guidelines, systematic processes, and concrete examples. Much more sophisticated than typical "expert persona" skills.

## Extraction Priority
- High
- Rationale: 105k+ stars with comprehensive skill collection containing extractable procedural knowledge. Self-improving agent methodology is particularly valuable for automated process optimization. Multiple domain processes and meta-methodology applicable to babysitter.
