## Summary
Claude Code plugin that measures whether AI agents follow prescribed workflows rather than just producing correct outputs. Evaluates across 7 dimensions: completeness, ordering, conditionality, parallelism, granularity, aggregation, and error handling. Features task catalog management, process definition using babysitter SDK, execution runners (local subprocess or Docker container modes), LLM-as-Judge scoring, and markdown report generation with dimension breakdowns.

## Assessment
EXTREMELY HIGH VALUE for babysitter validation. This benchmark directly addresses a critical gap in agent evaluation by focusing on process fidelity rather than just output correctness. The 7-dimension evaluation framework, babysitter SDK integration for process definition, and LLM-as-Judge scoring provide sophisticated methodologies for validating babysitter process compliance. The decoupling of "obedience" from "correctness" as orthogonal capabilities is essential for deployment trust.

## Extraction Priority
- Very High
- Rationale: This benchmark framework is specifically designed for babysitter process validation and could become an essential component of babysitter's quality assurance. The process fidelity evaluation and 7-dimension scoring framework are directly applicable to babysitter process improvement and validation workflows.

## Processes
- **Process Fidelity Benchmarking**: Evaluate agent adherence to prescribed workflows across 7 dimensions
- **LLM-as-Judge Process Scoring**: Analyze execution logs against process specifications for compliance assessment
- **Multi-Dimensional Process Evaluation**: Assess completeness, ordering, conditionality, parallelism, granularity, aggregation, error handling
- **Process Definition Validation**: Author and validate prescribed workflows using babysitter SDK patterns
- **Execution Environment Management**: Local subprocess and Docker container modes for isolated agent testing

## Plugin Ideas
- **Obedience Benchmark Integration**: Direct integration with obedience-benchmark for continuous process validation

## Patterns
- Process fidelity vs output correctness as orthogonal evaluation dimensions
- 7-dimension evaluation framework for workflow compliance
- LLM-as-Judge scoring methodology
- Babysitter SDK integration for process definition
- Multi-mode execution environments (local, Docker)
- Task catalog with domain/complexity filtering
- Markdown scorecard generation with dimension breakdowns
