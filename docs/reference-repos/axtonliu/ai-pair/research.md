## Summary
AI Pair Collaboration skill. Coordinates multiple AI models to work together: one creates (Author/Developer), two others review (Codex + Gemini). Works for code, articles, video scripts, and creative tasks. Uses Claude Code's native Agent Teams capability with heterogeneous model reviewers.

## Assessment
MEDIUM-HIGH VALUE. The multi-model review pattern (author + 2 reviewers from different model families) is a sophisticated orchestration pattern. The insight that "different AI models have fundamentally different review tendencies -- they look at completely different dimensions" is valuable. This maps directly to babysitter's multi-harness capabilities.

## Extraction Priority
MEDIUM-HIGH -- The heterogeneous-reviewer pattern is directly extractable:
- Multi-model review -> methodologies/ (quality assurance methodology)
- Team coordination -> specializations/shared/ (cross-domain collaboration pattern)

## Processes
1. **heterogeneous-ai-review** -- Author creates -> Codex reviews from angle A -> Gemini reviews from angle B -> synthesize feedback
2. **ai-dev-team** -- Developer + codex-reviewer + gemini-reviewer for code
3. **ai-content-team** -- Author + codex-reviewer + gemini-reviewer for content

## Plugin Ideas
- **multi-harness-review plugin**: Babysitter plugin that dispatches review tasks to multiple harnesses and synthesizes their feedback

## Implicit Procedural Knowledge
- Different model families find different categories of issues (coverage maximization through diversity)
- Team architecture: Commander (user) -> Team Lead (Claude) -> Specialists (Codex, Gemini)
- team-stop command for clean resource teardown
