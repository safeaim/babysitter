## Summary

Claude Code skills for building complete Godot 4 games from natural language descriptions. Ships 3 skills: `godogen` (main orchestrator), `godot-api` (C# Godot syntax reference), and `visual-qa` (visual quality assurance via screenshots). The orchestrator implements a sophisticated pipeline: visual target generation -> task DAG decomposition -> architecture scaffolding -> asset planning/generation -> task execution -> scene generation -> testing -> capture -> visual QA -> optional Android build. Uses a modular sub-file system where each pipeline stage has its own instruction file loaded on demand.

## Assessment

High value as a domain specialization exemplar. The pipeline architecture is the most sophisticated orchestration pattern seen in a skill repo -- a full DAG-based task decomposition with resume support (checks for existing PLAN.md), lazy sub-skill loading, and visual verification loop. The orchestrator pattern (reading sub-files from `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/` on demand) is a reusable pattern for complex multi-stage processes. Game development is a legitimate domain specialization.

## Extraction Priority
- High
- Rationale: Exceptional orchestration architecture. The DAG decomposition pipeline, resume/checkpoint support, and visual QA verification loop are directly transferable as process patterns. The game development domain itself maps to `specializations/game-dev/`.

## Processes

### 1. Game Generation Pipeline
- **Source skills**: godogen orchestrator
- **Placement**: `specializations/game-dev/godot-game-generation.js`
- **Description**: End-to-end game generation: requirement analysis -> visual target -> task DAG decomposition -> scaffold -> asset planning -> iterative task execution -> scene assembly -> test harness -> visual QA verification -> build.

### 2. Visual QA Verification Loop
- **Source skills**: visual-qa, capture
- **Placement**: `specializations/shared/visual-qa-verification.js`
- **Description**: Generic visual verification process: capture screenshot -> compare against visual target -> identify discrepancies -> generate fix tasks -> iterate until visual match. Applicable beyond game dev.

### 3. Task DAG Decomposition
- **Source skills**: godogen decomposer
- **Placement**: `methodologies/task-dag-decomposition.js`
- **Description**: Decompose a high-level goal into a directed acyclic graph of implementation tasks with dependencies, then execute in topological order. Generic pattern applicable to any complex build process.

## Plugin Ideas

- **Visual QA plugin**: Screenshot capture and comparison as a babysitter task type for visual regression testing. Category: QA & testing.
- **Godot Integration plugin**: Godot project scaffolding, scene generation, and build automation as babysitter tasks. Category: tools integration.

## Patterns

- Orchestrator skill with lazy sub-file loading (`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/` pattern)
- DAG-based task decomposition with topological execution ordering
- Resume/checkpoint support via plan file detection (PLAN.md, STRUCTURE.md, MEMORY.md)
- Visual target -> implementation -> visual QA feedback loop
- Pipeline stage table documenting when to read each sub-skill file
- Asset budget planning as a separate pipeline stage
