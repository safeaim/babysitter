## Overview

Claude Code plugin that enables Claude to write and execute arbitrary Playwright automation on-the-fly. Model-invoked (Claude decides when to use it). Uses progressive disclosure pattern (minimal SKILL.md with full API reference loaded on demand). Visible browser by default (headless: false). Includes smart temp file cleanup and universal module resolution.

## Extractable Value

### Processes

- No full development methodology to extract. Single-purpose tool.

### Plugin Ideas

1. **Browser Automation Plugin** (babysitter marketplace)
   - Wraps Playwright for model-invoked browser automation during process runs
   - Progressive disclosure pattern is worth adopting: minimal context by default, full API on demand
   - install.md-driven with npm setup script
   - Could enhance webapp-testing processes with on-demand browser interaction

### SKIP Reasons

- Not a methodology or process pattern
- The progressive disclosure pattern is the main architectural insight
- Overlaps significantly with anthropics/skills webapp-testing skill

### Notes

- MIT license, very permissive
- The progressive disclosure pattern (concise SKILL.md + lazy-loaded API reference) is a good practice to adopt in babysitter skill design
- Hasn't been updated since Dec 2025 - may be stale
