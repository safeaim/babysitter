## Summary
CLI proxy that reduces LLM token consumption by 60-90% on common dev commands. Single Rust binary with zero dependencies that transparently intercepts and compresses command outputs before LLM context. Supports 100+ commands across file operations, version control, testing, linting, cloud tools, containers, and package managers. Four optimization strategies: smart filtering, grouping, truncation, and deduplication. Integrates with 10 AI coding tools via transparent hook rewrites.

## Assessment
EXTREMELY HIGH VALUE for babysitter integration. The command output compression patterns and token optimization strategies directly apply to babysitter's task execution and context management. The transparent interception pattern, per-command-type compression heuristics, and integration with multiple AI harnesses provide proven methodologies. With 25.4k stars, this is a validated solution for LLM token optimization. The zero-overhead implementation (<10ms) and single binary distribution model are excellent patterns.

## Extraction Priority
- High
- Rationale: The command output compression techniques, transparent interception patterns, and multi-harness integration strategies are directly applicable to babysitter's task execution optimization. The 60-90% token reduction with proven performance makes this essential for scaling babysitter operations.

## Processes
- **Command Output Compression Pipeline**: Smart filtering, grouping, truncation, deduplication for LLM context optimization
- **Transparent Command Interception**: Zero-overhead bash hook interception for seamless integration
- **Per-Command-Type Optimization**: Custom compression heuristics for different command categories
- **Multi-Harness Integration Strategy**: Transparent hook rewrites for 10+ AI coding tools
- **Token Savings Analytics**: Measurement and reporting of compression effectiveness

## Plugin Ideas
- **RTK Integration**: Direct integration with RTK binary for command output compression in babysitter tasks
- **Command Compression Engine**: Built-in compression engine inspired by RTK's optimization strategies

## Patterns
- Zero-overhead bash hook interception (<10ms)
- Single compiled binary with no external dependencies
- Per-command compression heuristics (100+ commands)
- Token analytics with gain measurement
- Transparent AI tool integration
- Command discovery and pattern recognition
- Secret stripping for cloud operations
