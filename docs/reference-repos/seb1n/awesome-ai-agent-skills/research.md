- **Archetype**: domain-skill-pack
- **Stars**: 58
- **Last pushed**: 2026-03-02
- **License**: MIT
- **Discovered**: 2026-04-13
- **Source**: backlog evaluation
- **Skills found**: 90+ across multiple domains

## Summary
Comprehensive collection of 90+ universal, self-contained skills organized by domain (code-development, data-analytics, security, communication, devops, etc.). Each skill includes systematic workflows with concrete steps, multi-language support, and practical usage guidance. Claims to be "complete, ready-to-use instruction sets" rather than just a link directory.

## Assessment
High transferable value despite relatively low star count. Skills contain detailed procedural workflows rather than just expert personas. The refactoring skill demonstrates systematic 6-step process (identify smells → select patterns → plan order → apply → test → document) with concrete patterns and verification steps. Organized domain structure allows for easy extraction of domain-specific processes. Includes SKILL_TEMPLATE.md suggesting standardized skill creation methodology.

## Extraction Priority
- Medium-High
- Rationale: Systematic workflows with concrete procedures across multiple domains relevant to babysitter specializations. Quality over quantity - each skill appears to contain extractable procedural knowledge rather than just prompts.

## Harness Integration Ideas
N/A - This is not a harness framework repository.

## Implicit Procedural Knowledge
- **Code Smell Detection Strategy**: Systematic approach to identifying code quality issues across languages
  - Source: Refactoring skill's code smell identification methodology
  - Placement: specializations/shared/code-quality-assessment
  - Why codify: Reusable pattern for any code analysis task, not just refactoring
  - Sketch: Scan code → Identify patterns → Classify smells → Prioritize fixes → Document findings

- **Multi-Domain Skill Template**: Standardized approach to creating systematic skill definitions
  - Source: SKILL_TEMPLATE.md and consistent skill structure across domains
  - Placement: specializations/shared/skill-creation
  - Why codify: Template for creating high-quality, procedural skills rather than just expert personas
  - Sketch: Define workflow steps → Add concrete guidance → Include verification → Document usage patterns

- **Domain-Specific Process Extraction**: Method for identifying transferable procedures within domain-specific skills
  - Source: Systematic organization and procedural content across 90+ skills
  - Placement: specializations/shared/process-extraction
  - Why codify: Enables extraction of procedural knowledge from narrative skill descriptions
