## Summary
A "nano claude code-like agent harness" built from scratch in Python/Bash for educational purposes. Includes skills for PDF processing, code review, MCP server building, and agent building. The agent-builder skill contains a comprehensive agent design methodology: core philosophy ("the model already knows how to be an agent"), three elements (capabilities, knowledge, context), and design thinking framework.

## Assessment
HIGH VALUE. The agent-builder skill is a standout -- it contains a well-articulated agent design methodology that emphasizes simplicity and the model's inherent capability. The code-review skill and MCP-builder skill contain procedural workflows. The educational framing provides clear, extractable process definitions.

## Extraction Priority
HIGH -- The agent-builder methodology is directly extractable:
- Agent design thinking -> methodologies/ (agent architecture methodology)
- Code review skill -> already have code-review but may contain unique patterns
- MCP-builder -> specializations/shared/ (cross-domain MCP development process)

## Processes
1. **agent-design-thinking** -- Purpose -> Domain -> Capabilities (3-5 essential) -> Knowledge -> Context analysis
2. **agent-build-loop** -- The core agent loop: context + capabilities -> decide -> act or respond
3. **mcp-server-development** -- Process for building MCP servers from scratch
4. **code-review-workflow** -- Structured code review process

## Plugin Ideas
None specific -- methodology content, not tool integration.

## Implicit Procedural Knowledge
- "Start with 3-5 capabilities, add more only when agent consistently fails" -- capability minimalism principle
- "Make knowledge available, not mandatory. Load when relevant, not upfront" -- lazy knowledge loading
- "Context is precious. Isolate noisy subtasks. Truncate verbose outputs. Protect clarity" -- context hygiene
- The agent loop distilled to its simplest form
