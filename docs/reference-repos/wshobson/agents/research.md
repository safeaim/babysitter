## Key Features & Architectural Patterns

### Granular Plugin Architecture
- **77 focused plugins** optimized for minimal token usage and composability
- Average 3.6 components per plugin (follows Anthropic's 2-8 pattern)
- Each plugin completely isolated with its own agents, commands, and skills
- Install only what you need - no unnecessary resources loaded into context

### Agent Orchestration Models
- **182 specialized agents** across domain expertise areas
- **16 workflow orchestrators** for complex multi-agent operations
- **Progressive disclosure** - skills load knowledge only when activated
- **Three-tier model strategy** for Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6 & Haiku 4.5

### Skills System (149 Skills)
- Modular knowledge packages with progressive disclosure
- Token efficiency through selective loading
- Specialized expertise across domains
- Compatible with agent orchestration patterns

## Notable Orchestration Patterns

### Multi-Agent Review Systems
- `comprehensive-review` plugin with architect-review, code-reviewer, security-auditor
- Parallel analysis with different perspectives
- Coordinated feedback synthesis

### Full-Stack Orchestration
- `full-stack-orchestration` plugin for complex development workflows
- Multi-agent coordination for end-to-end development
- Phase-based execution with handoffs

### Agent Teams (Experimental)
- Parallel code review with specialized reviewers
- Hypothesis-driven debugging with multiple agents
- Research teams with parallel investigation streams

### Context-Driven Development (Conductor Plugin)
- Structured Context → Spec & Plan → Implement workflow
- Track-based development with semantic organization
- TDD workflow with verification checkpoints

## Quality Framework (PluginEval)

Three-layer evaluation framework:
- **Static analysis** (instant)
- **LLM judge** (semantic)
- **Monte Carlo simulation** (statistical)

Quality dimensions:
- Triggering accuracy, orchestration fitness, output quality
- Scope calibration, progressive disclosure, token efficiency
- Robustness, structural completeness, ecosystem coherence

## Technology Integration

- **Claude Code** as primary harness
- **Agent Skills** for knowledge management
- **Plugin marketplace** distribution model
- **Makefile** for development automation
- **CI/CD** integration patterns

## Extractable Processes

### Core Orchestration Patterns
1. **Multi-perspective review processes** - parallel expert analysis
2. **Progressive skill disclosure** - token-efficient knowledge loading
3. **Plugin composition strategies** - modular system assembly
4. **Agent handoff protocols** - structured workflow transitions

### Development Methodologies
1. **Context-driven development** - vision → spec → implementation
2. **Track-based organization** - semantic work unit management
3. **Verification checkpoint patterns** - quality gates in workflows
4. **Semantic revert strategies** - logical undo operations

### Quality Assurance Frameworks
1. **Multi-layer evaluation** - static, semantic, statistical analysis
2. **Anti-pattern detection** - automated quality assessment
3. **Statistical rigor** - Wilson score CI, bootstrap validation
4. **CI gate integration** - threshold-based quality control
