# Package Specifications

→ [Documentation Index](README.md) | Previous: [V6 Vision](v6-vision.md)

## Purpose

This document defines package responsibilities for the current V6 stage. It intentionally avoids large speculative API surfaces. A package appears here in one of three states:

- Current: exists now and is part of the executable plan.
- Candidate: may be extracted or renamed if a decision record justifies it.
- Deferred: useful vocabulary, but not a committed deliverable.

## 1. Current Packages

### `@a5c-ai/babysitter-sdk`

- State: Current
- Role: primary orchestration core and most stable architectural anchor
- Responsibilities:
- event-sourced run model,
- task definitions and replay,
- storage, CLI commands, hooks, process-library integration, profiles, plugins, compression, harness abstractions.
- Constraints:
- changes here have broad blast radius,
- extraction from the SDK requires strong evidence and explicit compatibility planning.

### `@a5c-ai/babysitter`

- State: Current
- Role: primary CLI package surface
- Responsibilities:
- user-facing CLI packaging,
- command routing and operational distribution of SDK-backed functionality.
- Constraints:
- must preserve install and operational expectations for existing users.

### `@a5c-ai/babysitter-agent`

- State: Current
- Role: harness runtime and orchestration-facing execution layer
- Responsibilities:
- harness invocation flows,
- session/runtime integration,
- orchestration runtime behaviors that are not yet proven as standalone packages.
- Constraints:
- still contains multiple concerns,
- should be improved by internal seam clarification before broad extraction.

### `plugins/*`

- State: Current
- Role: real integration and packaging boundaries
- Responsibilities:
- harness-specific hooks, commands, skills, manifests, and packaging outputs.
- Constraints:
- plugin manifests are a practical source of truth for compatibility,
- compiler changes must be checked against actual generated plugin metadata, not just intended schema.

## 2. Candidate Boundaries

These are plausible extraction or rename candidates, but not yet committed deliverables.

### Hook Multiplexing / Plugin Compilation Utilities

- State: Candidate
- Why it might be worth doing:
- the concepts already exist in repo history and surrounding docs,
- packaging and cross-harness compilation are real concerns with observable outputs.
- Extraction trigger:
- the subsystem can be tested and versioned with limited coupling.
- Do not extract if:
- the move mostly renames concepts without reducing risk or complexity.

### Internal Harness Runtime Seams

- State: Candidate
- Why it might be worth doing:
- `babysitter-harness` likely contains modules with cleaner ownership than the package boundary suggests.
- Extraction trigger:
- a subsystem has isolated tests, narrow dependencies, and clear consumers.
- Do not extract if:
- the seam requires widespread interface invention to stand alone.

### Packaging / Manifest Validation Layer

- State: Candidate
- Why it might be worth doing:
- packaging regressions have immediate user-visible consequences,
- manifest generation rules are concrete and measurable.
- Extraction trigger:
- validation logic becomes cohesive enough to own separately.
- Do not extract if:
- a small internal module or compiler correction is sufficient.

## 3. Deferred Package Vocabulary

The following names may be useful as future concepts, but they are not current package commitments:

- `@a5c-ai/agent-runtime`
- `@a5c-ai/agent-platform`
- `@a5c-ai/agent-platform-meta-plugins`
- `@a5c-ai/agent-platform-orchestration-plugin`
- `@a5c-ai/babysitter-agent`

For now, they should be treated as directional language only. Any one of them needs a decision record, validation plan, and migration story before it becomes normative.

## 4. Responsibility Rules

All package changes proposed under V6 should follow these rules:

1. Prefer internal module boundaries before creating a new package.
2. Prefer compatibility shims over forced flag days.
3. Prefer narrow responsibility tables over large imagined API contracts.
4. Prefer plugin/install validation over abstract packaging diagrams.
5. Prefer one proven seam over many hypothetical ones.

## 5. Package Specification Template

Any future package spec should fit this template:

- State
- Role
- Responsibilities
- Dependencies
- Consumers
- Validation method
- Rollback method
- Extraction or rename trigger

If a package cannot be described that way in one page, it is not ready.

## 6. Validation Expectations

For package-level changes, the default validation set is:

- build or test commands for the touched package,
- install or packaging checks if the package ships externally,
- manifest validation if plugin compilation is involved,
- compatibility notes if naming changes are introduced.

## 7. Invalidated Spec Style

The following spec patterns are explicitly rejected for the current V6 stage:

- multi-page invented API blocks for packages that do not exist,
- broad claims of plugin isolation or governance enforcement without implementation evidence,
- dependency graphs that imply committed packages without migration sequencing,
- package lists that obscure which items are real versus hypothetical.
