/**
 * @process generic-bugfix
 * @description Root-cause-first bugfix template with Phase 0 git-diff analysis. Enforces deep diagnosis before
 * implementation and verifies edge cases beyond the reported case. Replaces all
 * ad-hoc bugfix processes that vary in diagnostic depth.
 *
 * Structure: 6 phases
 *   Phase 1: Diagnostic (5-question checklist, requires 2+ independent evidence signals)
 *   Phase 2: Breakpoint — human reviews diagnosis before fix begins
 *   Phase 3: Implement fix (references diagnosis output)
 *   Phase 4: TypeScript check (hard shell gate — non-zero exit fails the run)
 *   Phase 5: Verify fix + edge cases (structured matrix: reported + boundary cases)
 *   Phase 6: Breakpoint — human reviews outcome
 *
 * @inputs
 *   projectDir {string} - Absolute path to the project directory
 *   issueDescription {string} - Plain-English description of the bug to fix
 *
 * @outputs
 *   diagnosis: { rootCause, evidenceForRootCause[], alternativeCausesRuledOut[], fixPlan }
 *   verification: { allChecksPassed, failedChecks[] }
 *
 * @agent senior-debugger (Phase 1), nextjs-developer (Phase 3), qa-engineer (Phase 5)
 *
 * @see shared/common.js for tsCheckTask definition
 * @see .a5c/processes/PROCESS-GUIDE.md for pre-flight diagnostic checklist
 *
 * Evidence: Duration warning bug fixed twice (incomplete verification);
 * parking address took 3 runs (first-plausible-fix diagnosis). Both preventable
 * with this template.
  * @graph
 *   domains: [domain:software-engineering]
 *   workflows: [workflow:bug-triage]

          `0. GIT HISTORY: Run \`git diff\` and \`git log --oneline -20\` to identify the specific commit(s) that introduced this regression. Document the breaking change.\n\n` +
          `1. REPRODUCE: What is the exact error message or incorrect behavior (copy verbatim, ` +
          `   not a paraphrase)? Which file(s) and line number(s) does the error originate from?\n\n` +
          `2. ISOLATE: What is the smallest reproduction case? Which component, function, or ` +
          `   code path triggers the issue?\n\n` +
          `3. ROOT CAUSE: What is the specific root cause? Be precise. "The function does X when ` +
          `   it should do Y" is acceptable. "There seems to be a problem" is not.\n\n` +
          `4. EVIDENCE: Provide at least TWO independent pieces of evidence that confirm this ` +
          `   root cause. Each piece must come from a different source (e.g., reading the ` +
          `   code directly, checking the data, running a command, examining a log). ` +
          `   A second piece of evidence that says "and also the code looks wrong" does not ` +
          `   count — it must be independently confirmatory.\n\n` +

          `   ruled out? What edge cases might be affected by the root cause?\n\n` +
          `NO CODE CHANGES: This diagnostic phase is for investigation only. You must NOT modify any ` +
          `code files during this phase. Only read, analyze, and document.\n\n` +
          `GUARD: You must document WHY the identified root cause is correct before any fix ` +
          `is attempted. Do not proceed to a fix plan until you have 2+ independent evidence signals.\n\n` +
