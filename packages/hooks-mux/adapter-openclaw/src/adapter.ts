/**
 * Creates the OpenClaw adapter capability descriptor.
 *
 * OpenClaw is a library-first (in-process) harness that exposes two distinct
 * hook layers:
 *
 *   1. **Gateway hooks** — internal lifecycle events fired by the OpenClaw
 *      gateway/router (e.g. request routing, auth, rate-limiting). These are
 *      infrastructure-level and do NOT map to canonical agent-lifecycle phases.
 *
 *   2. **Plugin hooks** — lifecycle events fired by OpenClaw plugins that
 *      participate in the agent conversation loop (session, tool, turn).
 *      These map cleanly to canonical phases.
 *
 * The adapter preserves this distinction by tagging normalized events with
 * an `origin` field ('gateway' | 'plugin') in execution metadata, and by
 * mapping only plugin hooks to canonical phases. Gateway hooks are mapped
 * to scope 'gateway' with supportLevel 'lossy' to signal they are not
 * semantically equivalent to agent-lifecycle phases.
 *
 * Spec section 17.9.
