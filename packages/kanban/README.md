Kanban surface for Babysitter runs and agent-mux sessions.

## What It Is

`@a5c-ai/kanban` is a single Next.js app under `packages/kanban` that combines:

- Babysitter run observability
- agent-mux session creation and live session browsing
- hook approval and inbox flows routed through agent-mux

The package is intentionally thin. It should wrap existing `agent-mux` capabilities instead of reimplementing deep gateway, session, or transport logic locally. If the UI needs a capability that does not exist yet, extend `agent-mux` directly and consume it here.

## Current Product Shape

- Run dashboard with live updates from Babysitter watcher state
- Session browser and new-session flow backed by agent-mux
- Gateway login and token persistence for local agent-mux access
- Inbox and hook approval surfaces backed by agent-mux UI primitives
- Compendium-based shell, forms, buttons, and branding primitives
- Settings page for runtime and gateway visibility

## Quick Start

### Run directly from the monorepo

```bash
npm install
npm run build --workspace=@a5c-ai/kanban
npm run build:cli --workspace=@a5c-ai/kanban
npm run start --workspace=@a5c-ai/kanban
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev --workspace=@a5c-ai/kanban
```

The app runs on `http://localhost:4800` by default.

## CLI

The package also publishes a `kanban` CLI entrypoint:

```bash
kanban --help
```

The CLI launches the packaged Next.js app in the same way the observer dashboard package does.

## Design System

The app should use the Compendium design system for user-facing controls and shared branding. When new UI is added:

- prefer Compendium components first
- keep local styling aligned with existing Compendium tokens
- avoid adding one-off primitives when Compendium already covers the case

## Scope Boundaries

- `packages/kanban` owns the Next.js shell and Babysitter-specific workflow presentation
- `packages/agent-mux` owns deep gateway, session, and transport integrations
- missing transport or session features should be added to `agent-mux`, then consumed here

## Gap Map

Feature gaps versus the original Vibe Kanban implementation are tracked in [gaps-and-debt.md](./gaps-and-debt.md).
