# Gaps: Agent Mux Experiences → Krate CRDs & UI

Status: Draft for review
Date: 2026-05-11

This document maps proven agent-mux UI/webui/core patterns to krate CRDs and UI experiences. Each section identifies what exists in agent-mux, what krate already has, and what's missing.

---

## 1. Transport & Adapter Layer

### What agent-mux has
Three adapter types form a discriminated union:
- **SubprocessAdapter** — spawn CLI processes (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, etc.)
- **RemoteAdapter** — HTTP/WebSocket/Unix socket connections to remote backends
- **ProgrammaticAdapter** — direct SDK integration via async iterables

Each adapter declares capabilities (resume, fork, streaming, thinking, tools) and supports different connection types (HttpConnection, WebSocketConnection).

### What krate has
- `AgentStack.spec.adapter` — string field (adapter ID)
- `AgentStack.spec.baseAgent` — enum of known agents
- `agent-mux-client.js` — thin stub with `isAvailable()`, `launchSession()`

### Gaps → New CRDs

| CRD | Purpose | Fields |
|-----|---------|--------|
| **AgentAdapter** | First-class adapter definition with transport type and capabilities | `spec.adapterType` (subprocess/remote/programmatic), `spec.transport` (http/websocket/unix/stdio), `spec.capabilities` (resume, fork, streaming, thinking, tools, models), `spec.authType` (token/oauth/none), `spec.installationMethod` (npm/binary/docker/remote), `spec.healthEndpoint` |
| **AgentTransportBinding** | Connection configuration for a specific adapter instance | `spec.adapterRef`, `spec.endpoint`, `spec.protocol` (http/ws/grpc/unix), `spec.authSecretRef`, `spec.healthCheck` (interval, timeout), `spec.reconnectPolicy` (backoff, maxRetries), `status.connected`, `status.lastHealthCheck` |
| **AgentProviderConfig** | Model provider configuration (Anthropic, OpenAI, Bedrock, etc.) | `spec.provider`, `spec.apiBase`, `spec.authType`, `spec.defaultModel`, `spec.modelTranslations` (canonical → provider-specific), `spec.rateLimits`, `spec.secretRef` |

### UI impact
Stack builder should let users pick adapter type, configure transport, test connectivity, and select models — not just type an adapter string.

## 2. Session & Chat Experience

### What agent-mux has
- **SessionWorkspaceShell** — 4-panel resizable layout (workspace, chat, execution trace, runtime)
- **SessionConversationSurface** — chat-like interface with human/agent turns
- **SessionFlowView** — 3-mode visualization (flow lanes, transcript, files)
- **Multi-lane agent flow** — parallel runs visualized as swimlanes
- **File-attention tracking** — which files each run reads/writes/touches
- **Cost tracking** — per-session USD with token breakdown
- **Session forking** — branch conversation to different agent mid-flight
- **Transcript pagination** — load last 60 messages, paginate further
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Shift+W/C/X/D to toggle panels
- **Attachments** — drag-drop files into compose box
- **Model picker** — inline model switching in compose
- **Agent picker** — switch agents creating forked session
- **Approval mode toggle** — yolo/prompt/deny per session

### What krate has
- `AgentSession` resource (metadata only — mux session ID, dispatch run ref)
- Basic `/agents/runs` list page (table of dispatch runs)
- No chat interface, no session detail, no flow visualization

### Gaps → New CRDs + UI

| CRD | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **AgentSessionTranscript** (aggregated) | Durable transcript with message nodes (user/assistant/tool/thinking/error), pagination support, cost per turn |
| **AgentSessionAttachment** (aggregated) | File attached to a session message — source (file/url/base64), mimeType, digest, redaction status |

| UI Route | Experience |
|----------|------------|
| `/agents/sessions/:id` | Full session detail: 4-panel layout adapted from SessionWorkspaceShell (workspace files, chat transcript, execution flow, runtime details) |
| `/agents/sessions/:id/flow` | Multi-lane flow visualization showing parallel runs as swimlanes |
| `/agents/sessions/:id/files` | File-attention view showing which files were read/written/touched |
| Chat compose in session detail | Input bar with agent picker, model picker, approval mode toggle, attachment drag-drop |

## 9. Event Streaming Infrastructure

### What agent-mux has
- **WebSocket** client with reconnect, subscription fan-out, backpressure
- **SSE** (Server-Sent Events) with batched updates and debouncing
- **Smart polling** with backoff (shorter when fresh, longer when stale)
- **EventBuffer** — sorted sequence numbers for correct replay on reconnect
- **67 structured event types** across 18 categories

### What krate has
- `/api/watch/orgs/:org/*` — SSE endpoint (existing, non-agent)
- No agent-specific event streaming

### Gaps → Infrastructure

| Event replay on reconnect | Buffer agent events with sequence numbers for catch-up |

---

## 10. Tool Rendering & Extensibility

### What agent-mux has
- **Extensible tool renderer registry** — `registerToolCallRenderer()` + `resolveToolCallRenderer()`
- **Built-in renderers** for 8 tools (bash, read, write, edit, glob, grep, web-fetch, web-search)
- **3 display modes** per renderer: compact, expanded, approvalPreview
- **MCP tool rendering** — separate card type for MCP-originated tools

### What krate has
- Nothing — no tool rendering

### Gaps → UI Infrastructure

The krate web console will need a tool rendering system when session detail views are built. This can import from `@a5c-ai/agent-mux-ui` or replicate the registry pattern.
