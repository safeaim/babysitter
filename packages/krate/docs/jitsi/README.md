# Jitsi Meet Integration — Requirements

Krate integration with [Jitsi Meet](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet) for real-time video conferencing with human and agent participants.

## Why

Krate orchestrates agents that work on code — but many workflows require real-time collaboration between humans and agents. Stand-ups, architecture reviews, incident response, pair programming. Today agents operate asynchronously via dispatch runs. Jitsi integration adds synchronous multi-party communication where agents can attend meetings alongside humans: listen, speak, share context, and take action.

## Scope

1. **Deploy Jitsi** — Helm subchart installs Jitsi Meet in the cluster
2. **Manage via CRDs** — JitsiMeetProvider, JitsiMeeting, JitsiMeetingTemplate, JitsiRecording as Kubernetes resources
3. **Sync controllers** — Reconcile CRD state with Jitsi server state (rooms, participants, recordings)
4. **Web console** — Create/join/manage meetings, configure Jitsi settings, view recordings
5. **Embedded meetings** — Full Jitsi iframe experience inside the krate web console
6. **Agent participation** — Agent stacks can declare meeting capability; dispatch injects Jitsi credentials into agent containers
7. **Agent runtime** — Agents join meetings via headless Jitsi client, process audio/text, and interact through the meeting
