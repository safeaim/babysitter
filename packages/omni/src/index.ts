/**
 * @a5c-ai/omni — Unified agent product
 *
 * Re-exports the full public API surface from every layer:
 *   L4  agent-core     — loop, subagent, context, synthesis
 *   L5  agent-runtime  — daemon, session, cost, observability, telemetry
 *   L6  agent-platform — harness, governance, CLI, interaction, storage
 *
 * agent-platform sits at the top of the dependency chain and already
 * re-exports key symbols from core and runtime, so it is the primary
 * barrel.  The lower layers are additionally available under namespaces
 * (`core`, `runtime`) for consumers that need unambiguous access.
