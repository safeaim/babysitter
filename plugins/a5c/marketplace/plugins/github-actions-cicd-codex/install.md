# GitHub Actions CI/CD (Codex) — Install Instructions

Set up babysitter-powered GitHub Actions workflows using [OpenAI's Codex Action](https://github.com/openai/codex-action) that trigger on issue comments, PR events, and other git events. Based on the [official GitHub Actions setup guide for Codex](https://github.com/a5c-ai/babysitter/blob/main/docs/github-actions-setup-codex.md).

## Step 1: Interview the User

Ask which workflow triggers and templates to install:

### Trigger Types

1. **Issue Comment Handler** (recommended) — Responds to `@codex` mentions in issue comments and PR review comments. This is the most versatile trigger.
2. **PR Review Automation** — Automatically runs babysitter-orchestrated code review when PRs are opened, synchronized, or marked ready for review.
3. **Feature Development (TDD)** — Triggers on issues labeled `feature-request`, implements features using TDD Quality Convergence methodology.
4. **GSD Quick Tasks** — Triggers on `/gsd` commands in issue comments for rapid prototyping.
5. **Spec-Driven Development** — Manual dispatch workflow for implementing specifications with compliance tracking.
6. **Security Scanning** — Scheduled + manual SAST pipeline using babysitter security-compliance processes.
7. **Incident Response** — Triggers on issues labeled `incident`, executes incident response procedures.
8. **Architecture Documentation** — Triggers on code changes or manual dispatch, generates C4 architecture docs.
9. **All** — Install all workflow templates.

### Additional Options

Ask the user:
- Which branch should workflows target? (default: `main`)
- Should workflows create PRs automatically? (default: yes)
- What timeout should be set for workflow runs? (default: 30 minutes)
- Which sandbox mode? (default: `workspace-write`; options: `workspace-write`, `read-only`, `danger-full-access`)
- Which safety strategy? (default: `drop-sudo`; options: `drop-sudo`, `unprivileged-user`, `read-only`, `unsafe`)

## Step 2: Create Workflow Directory

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

## Step 3: Create Workflow Files

Based on the user's selections, create the corresponding workflow YAML files. Each workflow uses the `openai/codex-action@v1` action with the babysitter SDK installed as a build step.

### Common Configuration Block

All workflows share this core configuration:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout repository
    uses: actions/checkout@v4
    with:
      fetch-depth: 1  # Use 0 for workflows that need git history

  - name: Install Babysitter SDK
    run: npm install -g @a5c-ai/babysitter-sdk

  - name: Run Codex with Babysitter
    uses: openai/codex-action@v1
    with:
      openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
      sandbox: "workspace-write"
```

**Note:** Unlike Claude Code, Codex does not have a native plugin marketplace. The babysitter CLI is installed via npm as a build step and is then available to Codex during execution. Prompts should instruct Codex that the `babysitter` CLI is available.

### Workflow: Issue Comment Handler (`babysitter-issue-comment.yml`)

```yaml
name: Codex with Babysitter

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]
  issues:
    types: [opened, assigned]

    if: |
      (github.event_name == 'issue_comment' && contains(github.event.comment.body, '@codex')) ||
      (github.event_name == 'pull_request_review_comment' && contains(github.event.comment.body, '@codex')) ||
      (github.event_name == 'issues' && contains(github.event.issue.body, '@codex'))
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:

        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1

      - name: Install Babysitter SDK
        run: npm install -g @a5c-ai/babysitter-sdk

      - name: Run Codex with Babysitter
        uses: openai/codex-action@v1

  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, ready_for_review, reopened]

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository

            REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
            PR NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}

            Analyze the PR changes for:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Security vulnerabilities
            - Performance implications
            - Test coverage

            REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
            ISSUE NUMBER: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}

            The process should:
            1. Write failing tests first
            2. Implement minimal code to pass tests
            3. Refactor for quality
            4. Iterate until 80% quality threshold is met

            Create a PR when complete.

            - System overview and dependencies
            - Data flow documentation
            - API documentation
            - Update docs/ directory with generated content

            Create a PR with the documentation updates.
```

## Step 4: Configure GitHub Secrets

Instruct the user to add the following secret to their repository (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions):

- **`OPENAI_API_KEY`** — Their OpenAI API key for Codex

If not already configured, guide them to:
1. Go to `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/settings/secrets/actions`
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
4. Value: their OpenAI API key

## Step 5: Configure Environment Variables (Optional)

Create a `.github/babysitter.env` reference file documenting available environment variables:

```
# Babysitter Configuration for GitHub Actions (Codex)
# Set these as env vars in your workflow YAML

# BABYSITTER_RUNS_DIR=.a5c/runs         # Runs directory (default: .a5c/runs)
# BABYSITTER_MAX_ITERATIONS=100          # Max iterations per run (default: 65000)
# BABYSITTER_QUALITY_THRESHOLD=85        # Quality gate threshold (default: 80)
# BABYSITTER_LOG_LEVEL=debug             # Log level: info|debug|warn|error
```

## Step 6: Add Artifact Preservation

Add a workflow step to preserve babysitter run artifacts for debugging. Instruct the user to add this step at the end of each workflow:

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  if: always()
  with:
    name: babysitter-runs
    path: .a5c/runs/
    retention-days: 7
```

## Step 7: Register Plugin

```bash
babysitter plugin:update-registry --plugin-name github-actions-cicd-codex --plugin-version 1.0.0 --marketplace-name marketplace --project --json
```

## Step 8: Verify Setup

After creating the workflow files:

1. Commit and push the `.github/workflows/` changes
2. Test the issue comment handler by creating an issue with `@codex` in the body
3. Verify the workflow triggers in the Actions tab
4. Check that babysitter SDK is installed correctly in the action logs
